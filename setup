# Follow along to set up your remote server where your Angular FullStack app will live.
# See the full in-depth tutorial at: http://erictsang.co/deploy-and-serve-yeoman-angular-fullstack

# There are TWO steps.

# STEP 1: -- Set the path to your git repo on this remote server 
repo=/root/repos/angular-fullstack

# STEP 2: Set your working directory, where you want your angular-fullstack app to live
dir=/root/angular-fullstack

##### DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE #####

# 1. Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# 2. Make a directory to store your git repository and initialize bare
mkdir -p $repo && cd $_
git init --bare

# 3. Clone a working directory where your app will be served
cd ~
git clone file://$repo

# 4. Set up post-receive hook so git can automatically deploy to your working directory
# - you'll need to create/edit a file at /root/repos/yeoman-angular-fullstack/hooks/post-receive

# 4b. copy and paste the 6 lines below into /root/repos/yeoman-angular-fullstack/hooks/post-receive
echo "Writing post-receive hook at " + $repo/hooks/post-receive
cat > $repo/hooks/post-receive << EOF
#!/bin/sh
git --work-tree=$dir --git-dir=$repo checkout -f
cd $dir
npm install
/usr/local/bin/pm2 kill
NODE_ENV=production /usr/local/bin/pm2 start $dir/server/app.js
EOF

# 4c. add execute privilege to /root/repos/angular-fullstack/hooks/post-receive
chmod +x $repo/hooks/post-receive
